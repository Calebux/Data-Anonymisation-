# Data-Anonymisation-
Starknet starter project - Data Anonymisation on Starknet

StarkNet Data Anonymization Project
Overview
Welcome to the StarkNet Data Anonymization Project! This project aims to showcase the implementation of a decentralized data anonymization solution on the StarkNet platform. By leveraging StarkNet's layer-2 scaling capabilities, we aim to create a secure and privacy-preserving environment for handling sensitive data using hashing or pseudonymization techniques.

Features
-
Decentralized Data Anonymization: Implement a decentralized data anonymization mechanism using StarkNet's layer-2 infrastructure, ensuring secure and private processing of sensitive information through hashing or pseudonymization.

Hashing/Pseudonymization Rules: Develop smart contracts that define and enforce anonymization rules using hashing or pseudonymization. These contracts enable automated execution of anonymization processes based on predefined conditions.

Efficient Data Storage: Optimize the storage of anonymized data on the StarkNet blockchain, ensuring both efficiency and scalability. Explore compression techniques and data structuring to enhance overall performance.
